# BroadStreet_Presentations

I analyzed CDC Wonder data on cerebrovascular disease mortality rates, specifically in New Jersey! Each of the presentations, parts 1 - 3, build off each other. The proposal presentations make reccomendations based off data analysis and visualizations to reduce cerebrovascular disease mortality rates in New Jersey, more specifically for Salem County.
